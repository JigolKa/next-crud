# Options

There are various options that you can use to extend the `ApiWrapper` function to fit your explicit needs.

## Hide fields

Want to hide sensitive data from responses? You are at the right place!

To hide a field, just do the following adjustements to your existing configuration:

```ts
export default ApiWrapper({
  prismaInstance: new PrismaClient(),
  models: {
    user: {
      creditCard: {
        hide: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

Where `creditCard` is a field of the `User` model.
This will hide the `creditCard` field from **every response**. (In nested objects too)

## Encrypt fields

Are you planning to store passwords, and don't want to store it in plain-text?
The encryption option is here to help:

```ts
export default ApiWrapper({
  prismaInstance: new PrismaClient(),
  models: {
    user: {
      password: {
        encryption: "AES 128",
      },
    },
  },
})
```

You have access to differents built-ins algorithms, which are the following:

```ts
type SupportedEncryptionAlgorithms = "Triple DES" | "AES 128" | "AES 256"
```

If you don't want to use those, you can still provide your own solution:

```ts
export default ApiWrapper({
  prismaInstance: new PrismaClient(),
  models: {
    user: {
      password: {
        // Base64 encryption/decryption
        encryption: {
          encypt: (plainTextValue) => {
            return Buffer.from(plainTextValue).toString("base64")
          },
          decrypt: (encryptedValue) => {
            return Buffer.from(encryptedValue, "base64").toString("ascii")
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

The two callbacks `encrypt` and `decrypt` are required if you want to use some custom encryption algorithm.

**Note**: To decrypt your fields, we have a factory function which maps the algorithm to a decrypt/encrypt callback. Just add this:

```ts
import { algorithms } from "@jigolka/next-crud/core/encryption"

algorithms("AES 128", "decrypt")("textToDecrypt")
```

The first argument is of type `SupportedEncryptionAlgorithms`, which look like the following:

```ts
export type SupportedEncryptionAlgorithms = "Triple DES" | "AES 128" | "AES 256"
```

## Frozen fields

Want to disable edit on peculiar fields? Add the following code in the config:

```ts
export default ApiWrapper({
  prismaInstance: new PrismaClient(),
  models: {
    user: {
      isAdmin: {
        freeze: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

The field `isAdmin` will no longer be editable via `PATCH` requests
