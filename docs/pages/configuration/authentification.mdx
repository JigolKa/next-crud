# Authentification

We provide a built-in authentication service, to restrict access to your routes.
The following code will reject all requests that don't have the `Authorization` header:

```ts
export default ApiWrapper({
  prismaInstance: new PrismaClient(),
  authentication: {
    callback: (req) => {
      // Here you can check for the validity of a JWT token,
      // retrieve/verify credentials, etc...
      return typeof req.headers["authorization"] !== undefined
    },
  },
})
```

If you want your user to be authenticated, your callback must return `true`.
Otherwise a 403 response will be sent back.

**Note**: The parameter `req` is of type `NextApiRequest`

## Specific methods

If you only want your `POST` requests to be authenticated against, you just need to provide an extra property to your configuration:

```ts
export default ApiWrapper({
  prismaInstance: new PrismaClient(),
  authentication: {
    methods: ["POST"],
  },
})
```

The default value is: `["POST", "PATCH", "DELETE"]`

## URL matcher

Want to authenticate your users only if the route matches a certain pattern?
Try this:

```ts
export default ApiWrapper({
  prismaInstance: new PrismaClient(),
  authentication: {
    matcher: /.*user$/gm,
  },
})
```

The above example matches all routes that ends with the string `user`

## Ignored routes

If you need to exclude routes from your authentication callback, you can add this option:

```ts
export default ApiWrapper({
  prismaInstance: new PrismaClient(),
  authentication: {
    ignoredRoutes: ["/api/user/abc"],
  },
})
```

This option will exclude the route `/api/user/abc` from the authentication process
